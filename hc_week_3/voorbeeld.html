			<h1>Introduction: Concepts and Media</h1>
			<blockquote>Concepts are centres of vibrations, each in itself and every one in relation to all others. <cite>Deleuze and Guattari (1994: 23)</cite></blockquote>

			<p id="first">The title of this book <em>New Media: The Key Concepts</em> appears self-explanatory. It suggests a book about the core concepts needed for the study of 'new' media technologies such as personal computers, MP3 players, mobile phones and other digital communications and storage devices. The quest for such concepts is indeed one aspect of the present work, but at the same time this book is no dictionary or encyclopaedia: it does not simply list concepts and definitions. Instead, it has a different purpose: to look, in particular, at six key concepts that facilitate theoretical and critical analysis of the new media age. The focus of this book is thus not simply the technical workings of new media technologies, although these will be touched upon in brief. Rather, the aim is to identify and define concepts for the analysis of emergent, highly technologized forms of social life and culture, and to look at how these concepts might be operationalized as <em>keys</em> for unlocking problems and barriers encountered in such research. The concepts to be studied here are: network, information, interface, archive, interactivity and simulation. It might be objected that by focusing in detail on only six concepts this book is a partial account, for many other concepts are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the new media age. This, of course, is true. But it is our belief that the six concepts chosen for study in this book are among the primary concepts required for this purpose. Together, when placed into contact with each other and also other concepts both old (such as power) and new (such as protocol or posthuman), they form a basic framework for analysis of contemporary society and culture; one which is intended to be open-ended and provisional, and which calls for further work by its very design.</p>

			<p>Concepts, however, are difficult things to study. Like technologies they are not static entities, and because of this they are hard to pin down and analyse. One reason for this is that all concepts, including those addressed in this book, have complex histories and are sites of fierce contestation both across and within disciplinary boundaries. This book seeks to give a flavour of this complexity by exploring the migration of a number of concepts (particularly information, network and interface) from computer or information science into the social sciences and humanities. It also charts the key struggles over definition and appropriation of these concepts that have taken place as a consequence. Even this exercise is more difficult than it might at first seem, for the six concepts addressed in this book are a complex mix of material forms (for example, networks, interfaces, archives and possibly information) and processes (simulation or interactivity) that have taken on a particular conceptual or metaphorical significance in recent social and media theory. A key task, then, is to see how these metaphors are constructed from and shaped by the material forms or processes they seek to comprehend, and subsequently how they function as rhetorical devices within different approaches to the study of new media. For while a number of these concepts are not new as such (particularly network and information), they have taken on new lives in a range of quite disparate theoretical writings on the digital age. What becomes clear is that concepts are never set in stone but are rather mobile devices (see <cite>Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 143; Urry 2000</cite>) that are formulated and applied in response to the problems of the day. This means that for concepts to be useful, they must be fast-moving and flexible, especially if they are to enable us to keep pace with the vast array of technological transformations that are shaping social life and culture today.</p>
